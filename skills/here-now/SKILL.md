# here.now

**Skill version: 1.6.4**

Publish any file or folder to the web and get a live URL back. Static hosting only.

To install or update (recommended): `npx skills add heredotnow/skill --skill here-now -g`

For repo-pinned/project-local installs, run the same command without `-g`.

If npm is unavailable, see fallback install docs: https://here.now/docs#install-skill

## Requirements

- Required binaries: `curl`, `file`, `jq`
- Optional environment variable: `$HERENOW_API_KEY`
- Optional credentials file: `~/.herenow/credentials`

## Publish

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh {file-or-dir}
```

Outputs the live URL (e.g. `https://bright-canvas-a7k2.here.now/`).

Under the hood this is a three-step flow: create/update -> upload files -> finalize. A publish is not live until finalize succeeds.

Without an API key this creates an **anonymous publish** that expires in 24 hours.
With a saved API key, the publish is permanent.

**File structure:** For HTML sites, place `index.html` at the root of the directory you publish, not inside a subdirectory. The directory's contents become the site root. For example, publish `my-site/` where `my-site/index.html` exists — don't publish a parent folder that contains `my-site/`.

You can also publish raw files without any HTML. Single files get a rich auto-viewer (images, PDF, video, audio). Multiple files get an auto-generated directory listing with folder navigation and an image gallery.

## Update an existing publish

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh {file-or-dir} --slug {slug}
```

The script auto-loads the `claimToken` from `.herenow/state.json` when updating anonymous publishes. Pass `--claim-token {token}` to override.

Authenticated updates require a saved API key.

## Client attribution

Pass `--client` so here.now can track reliability by agent:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh {file-or-dir} --client cursor
```

This sends `X-HereNow-Client: cursor/publish-sh` on publish API calls.
If omitted, the script sends a fallback value.

## API key storage

The publish script reads the API key from these sources (first match wins):

1. `--api-key {key}` flag (CI/scripting only — avoid in interactive use)
2. `$HERENOW_API_KEY` environment variable
3. `~/.herenow/credentials` file (recommended for agents)

To store a key, write it to the credentials file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.herenow && echo "{API_KEY}" > ~/.herenow/credentials && chmod 600 ~/.herenow/credentials
```

**IMPORTANT**: Never pass the API key directly in shell commands. Always write it to `~/.herenow/credentials` using the command above. This keeps the key out of terminal history and logs.

Never commit credentials or local state files (`~/.herenow/credentials`, `.herenow/state.json`) to source control.

## State file

After every publish, the script writes to `.herenow/state.json` in the working directory:

```json
{
  "publishes": {
    "bright-canvas-a7k2": {
      "siteUrl": "https://bright-canvas-a7k2.here.now/",
      "claimToken": "abc123",
      "claimUrl": "https://here.now/claim?slug=bright-canvas-a7k2&token=abc123",
      "expiresAt": "2026-02-18T01:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Before publishing, you may check this file to find prior slugs for updates.
Treat `.herenow/state.json` as internal cache only.
Never present this local file path as a URL, and never use it as source of truth for auth mode, expiry, or claim URL.

## What to tell the user

- Always share the `siteUrl` from the current script run.
- Read and follow `publish_result.*` lines from script stderr.
- Only state "expires in 24 hours" when `publish_result.auth_mode=anonymous`.
- Only share a claim URL when `publish_result.claim_url` is non-empty and starts with `https://`.
- Never tell the user to inspect `.herenow/state.json` for claim URLs or auth status.
- Warn: claim tokens are only returned once and cannot be recovered.

## Limits

|                | Anonymous          | Authenticated                |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Max file size  | 250 MB             | 5 GB                         |
| Expiry         | 24 hours           | Permanent (or custom TTL)    |
| Rate limit     | 5 / hour / IP      | 60 / hour / account          |
| Account needed | No                 | Yes (get key at here.now)    |

## Getting an API key

To upgrade from anonymous (24h) to permanent publishing:

1. Ask the user for their email address.
2. Request a one-time sign-in code:

```bash
curl -sS https://here.now/api/auth/agent/request-code \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}'
```

3. Tell the user: "Check your inbox for a sign-in code from here.now and paste it here."
4. Verify the code and get the API key:

```bash
curl -sS https://here.now/api/auth/agent/verify-code \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","code":"ABCD-2345"}'
```

5. Save the returned `apiKey`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.herenow && echo "{API_KEY}" > ~/.herenow/credentials && chmod 600 ~/.herenow/credentials
```

| `--client {name}`      | Agent name for attribution (e.g. `cursor`)    |
